# Workout Planner
This full-stack project is centered around developing a workout management system. As an avid gym-goer, my goal is to provide users with an intuitive and efficient platform to log, update, and track their workouts, solving the common inconvenience of using a notes app or a pen and notebook.

### Usage
1. Install Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tleng26/workout-planner.git`
3. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend` `npm install`
4. Set up .env file in backend folder by replacing MONGO_URI (create a free MongoDB account)
5. Start backend server: `npm run dev`
6. Install frontend dependencies in another terminal: `cd frontend` `npm install`
7. Start frontend server: `npm start`
8. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the website!
